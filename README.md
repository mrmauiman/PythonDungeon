# Python Dungeon
This is a small dungeon game made in python.

## How To Run
The entire game's code can be found in dungeon.py.
You must compile the dungeon file to run.

## Works Used
I used some sprites from The Legend of Zelda on NES.
The graphics.py and sprite.py are libraries created by Dr. Bouchard at Roanoke College.

## Short Comings
Classes aren't used in the game because this was created in an introductary python course and we were only supposed to use what we had learned thus far.
